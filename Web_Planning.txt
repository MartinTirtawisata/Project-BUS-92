List of information that the website will contain:



- Names of the clubs/associations
- Ratings 0-5
- Reviews of each person
- Link to each club/associations' website, Facebook account, Twitter, etc.
- Meeting dates
- Location of meeting dates
- There will also be a feature to allow users to propose a new club/association



Other Ideas:
- Send a mass email to all Clubs' officers, informing them of our project, asking them
	for information on: Meeting dates, meeting locations, and how many members they have.
