SELECT * FROM SJSU_Organizations;

SELECT Organization, Rating, Location FROM SJSU_Organization;

SELECT Club_ID,Membership_cost,Payment_required FROM SJSU_Clubs;

2) Create 3 SELECT statements querying certain fields using a complex WHERE clause, using
combinations of AND and/or OR

SELECT * FROM SJSU_Organization 
WHERE Rating = 3 
AND Number_of_reviews > 1;

SELECT * FROM SJSU_Clubs
WHERE Payment_required = "Yes"
OR membership_cost < 500;

SELECT Organization, Classification, Rating, number_of_reviews FROM SJSU_Organization
WHERE Rating > 3
AND (Classification = "Special Interest"
OR Classification = "Academic");

3) Create 3 SELECT queries using the WHERE and the LIMIT clause

SELECT * FROM SJSU_Organization 
WHERE Rating = 2
AND Number_of_reviews > 1
LIMIT 15;

SELECT * FROM SJSU_Clubs
WHERE Payment_required = "No"
OR membership_cost > 600
LIMIT 5;

SELECT Organization, Classification, Rating, number_of_reviews FROM SJSU_Organization
WHERE Rating > 3
AND (Classification = "Special Interest"
OR Classification = "Academic")
LIMIT 20;

4) Create 3 SELECT queries showing all the fields for some maximum or minimum

SELECT Organization, Classification, max(Rating) FROM SJSU_Organization;

SELECT Organization, Classification, min(Rating) FROM SJSU_Organization;

SELECT club_id, max(membership_cost), payment_required, description, president
FROM SJSU_clubs;

5) Create 6 SELECT queries showing a join between your two tables using aliases, WHERE clauses
and AND/OR

SELECT * FROM SJSU_Organization
JOIN SJSU_Clubs
ON SJSU_Clubs.club_id = SJSU_organization.club_id
WHERE sjsu_organization.rating = 3
AND sjsu_clubs.membership_cost > 500 
ORDER BY membership_cost;

SELECT O.Organization, O.Classification, O.Location, C.Payment_required,C.Description FROM SJSU_Organization as o
JOIN SJSU_Clubs as c
ON C.club_id = O.club_id
WHERE c.payment_required = "Yes"
AND O.classification = "Fraternity/Sorority";

SELECT O.Organization, O.Classification, O.Location, C.Payment_required,C.Description FROM SJSU_Organization as o
JOIN SJSU_Clubs as c
ON C.club_id = O.club_id
WHERE c.payment_required = "No"
AND o.classification = "Academic";

SELECT * FROM SJSU_Organization as o
JOIN SJSU_Clubs as c
ON C.club_id = O.club_id
WHERE o.rating > 3
OR (c.membership_cost > 500
AND o.number_of_reviews = 3)
ORDER BY o.rating DESC, o.classification;

SELECT o.club_id, o.classification, o.rating, c.membership_cost, c.description, c.president FROM SJSU_Organization as o
JOIN SJSU_Clubs as c
ON C.club_id = O.club_id
WHERE o.rating < 3
OR (c.membership_cost < 500
AND o.number_of_reviews = 2)
ORDER BY c.membership_cost DESC, o.rating;

SELECT o.organization, o.classification, o.rating, c.payment_required, c.membership_cost, c.description
FROM SJSU_Organization as o
JOIN SJSU_Clubs as c
ON C.club_id = O.club_id
WHERE( o.classification = "Academic"
OR o.classification = "Special Interest")
AND c.membership_cost > 700
ORDER BY o.organization;
